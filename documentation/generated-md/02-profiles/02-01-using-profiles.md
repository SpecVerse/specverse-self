# Example 02-01: Using Profiles

This example demonstrates SpecVerse's powerful profile attachment system in v3.2, enabling dynamic composition of model functionality based on runtime conditions.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand profile-attachment configuration and criteria in v3.2
- Learn how profiles extend base models without inheritance
- Master dynamic profile attachment for flexible model composition
- Explore profile-based behavioral extensions
- Design composable model architectures

## Key Concepts

### Profile Attachment System in v3.2

The profile attachment system allows models to dynamically acquire new capabilities through profile composition. Profiles are separate models that can attach to base models conditionally.

```specly
components:
  SpecVerseProfiles:
    models:
      DigitalProductProfile:
        description: "Profile for digital products (downloads, software, etc.)"
        attributes:
          downloadUrl: String required
          fileSize: String
          fileFormat: String
          license: String required
        profile-attachment:
          profiles: [Product]
```

### Profile Model Pattern

Profiles are regular models with a special `profile-attachment` section that defines which models they can extend:

```specly
PhysicalProductProfile:
  description: "Profile for physical products (shipping, inventory, etc.)"
  attributes:
    weight: Number required
    dimensions: String
    shippingClass: String required
    fragile: Boolean default=false
  profile-attachment:
    profiles: [Product]
```

### Dynamic Composition

Profiles enable runtime composition without traditional inheritance:

```specly
# Base model remains simple and focused
Product:
  description: "Base product model that can be extended with profiles"
  attributes:
    id: UUID required unique
    name: String required
    price: Money required
    category: String required

# Profiles add specialized capabilities
DigitalProductProfile:
  attributes:
    downloadUrl: String required
    license: String required
    downloadLimit: Integer default=5
  profile-attachment:
    profiles: [Product]
```

## Profile Attachment Pattern

The profile attachment system enables flexible model composition:

1. **Base Model** - Product provides core functionality
2. **Profile Models** - DigitalProductProfile and PhysicalProductProfile add specialized attributes
3. **Attachment Declaration** - `profile-attachment: profiles: [Product]` defines which models can be extended
4. **Runtime Composition** - Profiles attach to Product instances based on business logic

## Benefits of Profile System

### Composition Over Inheritance
- Multiple profiles can potentially attach to the same model instance
- Profiles provide functionality without rigid class hierarchies  
- Business logic emerges from profile interactions

### Modular Design
- Base models remain simple and focused
- Profiles add specialized capabilities only when needed
- Clear separation of concerns across different product types

### Reusability
- Profiles can be designed to attach to multiple model types
- Common patterns can work across different entities
- Profile attributes are self-contained and testable

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Profile-attachment**: Dynamic model composition in v3.2
- **Specialized attributes**: Different profiles for different product types
- **Container format**: v3.2 components and deployments structure
- **Convention syntax**: `name: Type modifiers` attribute definitions
- **Import system**: Shared types from common definitions

## Validation

Test this example:
```bash
# Validate the Specly source file
specverse validate examples/02-profiles/02-01-using-profiles.specly

# Run full test cycle
specverse test cycle examples/02-profiles/02-01-using-profiles.specly
