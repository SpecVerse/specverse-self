**Complete file**: [04-01-digital-product-catalog.specly](./04-01-digital-product-catalog.specly)

### Validation

To validate the specification:

```bash
# Validate Specly file directly
specverse validate 04-01-digital-product-catalog.specly
```

This demonstrates the v3.2 **single source** architecture where:
- **Specly DSL** serves as the primary, human-readable specification
- Direct validation without intermediate formats
- All tooling works directly with .specly files

## Architecture Patterns

### V3.1 Profile-Attachment Architecture
- **Dynamic Profiles**: DigitalProductProfile and SubscriptionProfile attach to base Product model
- **Behavioral Extension**: Profiles add specific behaviors (generateDownloadLink, calculateSubscriptionPrice)
- **Type Safety**: Profile-specific attributes with validation and constraints
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Flexible product categorization without complex hierarchies

### Event-Driven Service Architecture
- **Typed Events**: All events use `attributes` (not payload) with strongly-typed fields
- **Service Publishing**: PaymentService publishes PaymentProcessed, controllers publish domain events
- **Cross-Service Communication**: Events enable decoupled service interactions
- **Event Attributes Pattern**: ProductPurchased includes purchaseId, customerId, productId, amount, licenseKey, purchaseDate

### Controller-Service Separation
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP/API concerns with actions that publish events
- **Services**: Contain business logic with operations that process data
- **Clear Boundaries**: Controllers manage requests/responses, services handle domain logic
- **Event Integration**: Both can publish events for different architectural concerns

### V3.1 Component Architecture
- **Explicit Exports**: Components declare exactly what they expose (models, controllers, services, events)
- **Import Management**: Structured imports with file paths and selective type importing
- **Modular Design**: Self-contained components with clear interfaces
- **Version Management**: Component-level versioning for independent evolution

## Key Features Demonstrated

### V3.1 Core Features
- **Profile-Attachment System**: DigitalProductProfile and SubscriptionProfile extend Product with specialized behaviors
- **Typed Event Attributes**: Events use structured attributes (not payload) with full type safety
- **Service Architecture**: PaymentService, DownloadService, NotificationService demonstrate business logic separation
- **Controller Actions**: Multiple controllers (ProductController, SubscriptionController, InventoryController, CatalogController) with specific responsibilities
- **Component Exports**: Explicit declaration of models, controllers, services, and events for clean module boundaries

### Advanced Patterns
- **Behavioral Composition**: Profile behaviors (generateDownloadLink, validateLicense) extend base model capabilities
- **Event Publishing Chain**: Controllers publish domain events, services publish integration events
- **Multi-Profile Products**: Single Product model supports both digital download and subscription profiles
- **Relationship Management**: Complex hasMany/belongsTo relationships between Customer, Product, Purchase, Subscription
- **Business Logic Encapsulation**: Service operations with requires/ensures contracts and event publishing

### Real-World Integration
- **Payment Processing**: Complete payment flow with validation and confirmation
- **Digital Asset Management**: Secure download generation with licensing and tracking
- **Subscription Management**: Full subscription lifecycle with billing and access control
- **Inventory Tracking**: Stock management with automated alerts and threshold monitoring
- **Customer Notification**: Automated email confirmations and communication workflows

## Business Use Cases

- **E-commerce platforms**: Product catalog management
- **Digital marketplaces**: Multi-vendor product systems
- **SaaS applications**: Feature catalog and pricing
- **Content platforms**: Digital asset management

## Validation

Validate the Specly DSL format:
```bash
specverse validate examples/04-domains/04-01-digital-product-catalog.specly
```
